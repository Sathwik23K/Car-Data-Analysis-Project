# Car-Data-Analysis-Project
This project utilizes Python to analyze a car dataset. It's designed for beginners to learn data manipulation techniques. 
The project guides you through:
* Data Import: Importing car data from a CSV file using pandas.
* Data Cleaning: Checking for errors and missing entries.
* Data Manipulation: Applying functions to answer specific questions about the data (e.g., finding averages, filtering data).
* Data Transformation: Converting data types (e.g., changing string dates to numerical format). 
This project provides a foundation for further exploration of car data analysis using Python.
